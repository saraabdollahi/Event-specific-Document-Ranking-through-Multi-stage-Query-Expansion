# **Event-specific Document Ranking through Multi-stage Query Expansion**

Welcome to the GitHub repository for the paper titled 'Event-specific Document Ranking through Multi-stage Query Expansion using an Event Knowledge Graph'. This repository contains the implementation code for the MusQuE model and the created dataset Ms-Marco-Event. Please note that author names and specific details cannot be disclosed due to the anonymous submission.


## **Dataset: Ms-Marco-Event**
 
Ms-Marco-Event dataset is created based on the MS-MARCO dataset and the EventKG event knowledge graph. This dataset contains event-related queries from Ms-Marco dataset. Please refer to the main [MS-MARCO dataset] (https://microsoft.github.io/msmarco/Datasets.html) for more detailed information and specific dataset guidelines.

## **MusQuE**

MusQuE is an approach for event-specific document ranking through Multi-stage Query Expansion. We provide the implementation of MusQuE for training and evaluation.
